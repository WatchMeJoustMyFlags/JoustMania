# Agent

Adaptive-difficulty agent that turns live telemetry into intervention decisions.

## Overview

The Agent sits between JoustMania's **observation layer** (OpenTelemetry) and its
**control layer** ([OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) / flagd). It receives
spans and metrics from the OTel Collector over OTLP, accumulates a rolling
`GameContext`, gates on whether the context is worth acting on, and calls stub
decision hooks that will eventually drive feature-flag changes.

The Collector fans telemetry out to the Agent via an `otlp/agent` exporter wired
into the existing **traces** and **metrics** pipelines — the Agent receives the
same signals as the rest of the observability stack, no new instrumentation
required.

Written in Go using the OpenTelemetry Collector `pdata` libraries and standard
`net/http` for health checks.

### Signal timing (design note)

**Metrics are the primary, timely signal source.** Counter/gauge updates reach
the Agent in roughly **100 ms – 1 s** end to end, so difficulty decisions are
driven by metrics.

**Spans are late by design.** `player_lifecycle` spans only flush at game end,
and even then sit behind the ~10 s trace batch window. They are used for
**audit/confirmation** of decisions, never as the timely trigger.

The metric extractor already recognizes **both** today's metric names **and** the
five #722-proposed metrics, so each signal lights up automatically the moment its
producer ships:

- `game_player_movement_variance`
- `game_player_skill_level`
- `controller_battery_pct`
- `game_player_elimination_order`
- `game_interventions_total`

## GameContext

The Agent accumulates context at two scopes.

| Scope | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| **Per-player** | `movement_intensity`, `movement_variance`, `battery_pct`, `skill_level`, `active` |
| **Per-session** | `duration_seconds`, `active_player_count`, `elimination_sequence` |

### Session identity heuristic

Sessions are not carried in every signal, so the Agent synthesizes them:

- A new synthetic session (`session-N`) is created when `game_active` transitions
  **0 → 1**.
- Once a `game_id` label is observed, the synthetic session **adopts** that id.

### Staleness & eviction

| Entity | Rule |
|--------|------|
| Player | Evicted after a **5 s** TTL with no fresh signal |
| Session | Kept for a **15 s** grace period after it goes inactive, then evicted |

## Gating & decisions

After each context update the Agent evaluates `should_evaluate`. When the gate
opens it invokes the decision hooks:

- **Rules engine** (#726) — evaluates the `GameContext` into intervention intents.
- **Action sink** (#730) — applies intents via OpenFeature/flagd.

Both are stubs today. See
[`docs/research/722-intervention-surface.md`](../../docs/research/722-intervention-surface.md)
for the intervention-surface design.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AGENT_LISTEN_ADDR` | `:4317` | OTLP gRPC receiver listen address |
| `AGENT_HEALTH_ADDR` | `:13134` | HTTP health endpoint listen address (`GET /healthz`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Log verbosity |
| `OTEL_*` | _unset_ | Self-telemetry; currently **no-op** (tracked in a separate issue) |

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **OTLP port** | 4317 |
| **Health port** | 13134 |
| **Health check** | `GET /healthz` |

```

## Local smoke test

With the compose stack up (Agent reachable as `agent:4317` on the `joustmania`
network), push synthetic metrics with
[telemetrygen](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/cmd/telemetrygen):

```bash
docker run --rm --network joustmania \
  ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/telemetrygen:latest \
  metrics --otlp-insecure --otlp-endpoint agent:4317 --duration 5s
```
